# iLyrics
a project that took me so many hours to do
Todo : get better at backend and api connection displaying data on website.
Backend is a pain for me but i try lel.
Web Application that searches for song lyrics for you although only about 40% of the lyrics 
if u want more and a solid build for business you can upgrade and access the full 100% lyrics. 
They offer so many options and i like their API variety.


TODO style it up better in the future.
